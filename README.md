## What will happen to the unemployment rate post pandemic?
The US ecomonoy has gone through some dramatic changes over the last several years. The hardest hit was the labor force.
Non essential workers were hit hard during national shutdowns. This caused many employers to resort to remote learning or even early retirment.
These major adjustments effected the housing market, stock market, and overall way of living. What will happen to the employment 
rates as the nation recovers from a 2 year pandemic?  We will attempt to predict the unemployment rate taking into consideration 
a broad spectrum of economic factors including stock market data, real estate sales, advance retail sales, and inflation rates.
In addition to these indicators of the overal US economy, we will include data on Covid-19 cases and deaths as the pandemic will continue 
to exert an influence on the lives of Americans.  The Covid-19 pandemic is a world-wide issue, but we are focusing on the United States.
